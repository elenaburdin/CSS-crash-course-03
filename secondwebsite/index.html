            <p>The French word mode, meaning "fashion", dates as far back as 1482, while the English word denoting
                something "in style" dates only to the 16th century. Other words exist related to concepts of style and
                appeal that precede mode.</p>

            <p>Fashion is defined in a number of different ways, and its application can be sometimes unclear. Though
                the term fashion connotes difference, as in "the new fashions of the season", it can also connote
                sameness, for example in reference to "the fashions of the 1960s", implying a general uniformity.
                Fashion can signify the latest trends, but may often reference fashions of a previous era, leading to
                the reappearance of fashions from a different time period. While what is fashionable can be defined by a
                relatively insular, esteemed and often rich aesthetic elite who make a look exclusive, such as fashion
                houses and haute couturiers, this 'look' is often designed by pulling references from subcultures and
                social groups who are not considered elite, and are thus excluded from making the distinction of what is
                fashion themselves.</p>

            <p>A fashion trend signifies a specific look or expression that is spread across a population at a specific
                time and place. A trend is considered a more ephemeral look, not defined by the seasons when collections
                are released by the fashion industry. A trend can thus emerge from street style, across cultures, and
                from influencers and other celebrities.</p>
